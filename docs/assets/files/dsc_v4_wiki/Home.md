"The aim of the Dataspace Connector is to provide companies with an easy and trustworthy entry into 
the International Data Spaces. There are three levels of certification for the International Data 
Spaces, an initiative for cross-industry data exchange with over 100 European companies: Base, 
Trusted and Trusted+. The DSC was deliberately tested for the Base certification level, as this does 
not require specific hardware such as Trusted Platform Module chips in order to use the connector. 
This makes it easier to use the DSC on different hardware and in cloud environments with a reasonable 
sacrifice of hardware security features. 

In addition, the Dataspace Connector is the only IDS connector that already supports the enforcement 
of eight usage condition classes of the International Data Spaces Association and thus exceeds the 
Base certification level."

## Supported Features

This is a list of currently implemented features, which is continuously updated.

*  Settings for TLS, proxy and Spring Boot basic authentication for backend endpoints
*  Use valid IDS certificate and request DAT from DAPS
*  Data resource registration (CRUD metadata) with internal H2 database or an external database
*  Possibility to add multiple representations (different backend connections) to a resource
*  Backend data handling internal (CRUD data) with internal H2 database or an external database
*  Backend data handling external via `http GET` or `https GET` (with basic auth)
*  IDS message handling with other IDS Connectors (as data provider and data consumer): 
`DescriptionRequestMessage`, `DescriptionResponseMessage`, `ArtifactRequestMessage`, `ArtifactResponseMessage`, 
`ContractRequestMessage`, `ContractAgreementMessage`, `ContractRejectionMessage`, `RejectionMessage`
*  Read IDS response messages: deserialize and save requested data & metadata in internal database
*  IDS message handling with the IDS Broker (IDS Lab): `ConnectorUpdateMessage`, `ConnectorUnavailableMessage`, 
`ResourceUpdateMessage`, `ResourceUnavailableMessage`, `QueryMessage`
* Further supported message types: sending `NotificationMessage` and `LogMessage`, receiving `NotificationMessage` 
* Receiving `ResourceUpdateMessage` and updating the data automatically.
*  Usage control with 9 ODRL policy patterns following the IDS policy language specifications: 
`provide access`, `prohibit access`, `usage during interval`, `n times usage`, `duration usage`, 
`usage until deletion`, `usage logging`, `usage notification`, `connector-restricted usage`
