## PostgreSQL

The Dataspace Connector uses an internal H2 database per default. When deploying the Dataspace Connector in a 
Kubernetes cluster, this will lead to inconsistencies as soon as there are multiple connector replicas. Therefore, an 
external database should be used. 

Execute the 3 following commands in the given order in the root directory of the project to start a PostgreSQL database that the Dataspace Connector can use:

```
kubectl create -f postgres-configmap.yaml
kubectl apply -f postgres-deployment.yaml
kubectl expose -f postgres-service.yaml 
```

Now, a PostgreSQL instance is running and accessible by other services in the cluster using the `service name` 
(*postgres*) and the `service port` (*5432*).

## Dataspace Connector

### Secret

Kubernetes uses secrets for storing sensitive data like passwords or certificates. The Dataspace Connector uses an IDS 
certificate, an SSL certificate, and a truststore, all of which should not be exposed to the outside or be easily 
accessible. Thus, these files should be stored in a secret, which can then be mounted to a specified directory of the 
Dataspace Connector pods. 

If you want to use an external configuration (`config.json`), you can add it to the secret as well or create a
second secret containing the configuration. 

> **Note**: The example deployment expects the configuration to be in the same secret as the certificates.

To create a secret, put all files it should contain in a directory and execute the following command:

```
kubectl create secret generic dataspace-connector-certs --from-file=path/to/certs/directory
```

If you create a second secret, be sure to define and mount that in `deployment.yaml` and, if necessary, change the 
property `CONFIGURATION_PATH` to point to the config file in the specified mounted directory. If you don't want to use 
an external configuration file, delete the property `CONFIGURATION_PATH` from `deployment.yaml`.

### Deployment

A deployment tells Kubernetes how to set up an application. That includes e.g. the image to use, environment variables, 
and resource requirements (memory, CPU). The `deployment.yaml` gives an example on how to configure the Dataspace 
Connector deployment.

#### Configuration

##### Settings from `application.properties`

At `env`, all properties presented in or being available for Spring's `application.properties` can be added or overridden.
In the example, the Dataspace Connector uses a PostgreSQL database. If you want to use another database, the 
corresponding database values can be changed here. You can also set the path to the configuration file in case of 
supplying an external configuration file or specify the SSL certificate to use.

##### Image 

The registry and specific images to be used for the deployment can be configured at `image`. In the example, a local 
docker registry running on port 5000 is used. For the example, the 
[local registry](https://docs.docker.com/registry/deploying/) has to be running and contain the Dataspace Connector 
image. Alternatively, you can change the registry and image name in the deployment file or omit the registry to use a 
locally built image.

If you want to use a private registry that requires credentials, first create a docker-registry secret:

```
kubectl create secret docker-registry registry-credentials --docker-server=[registry-server] --docker-username=[username] --docker-password=[password] --docker-email=[email]
```

You can then tell Kubernetes to use this secret when pulling the image by adding the following lines to 
`deployment.yaml` at `spec` with `imagePullSecrets` being on the same level as `containers` and `volumes`:

```
imagePullSecrets:
  - name: registry-credentials
```

##### Mounted directory

In the example, the secret containing the key- and truststores as well as the configuration file is mounted to the 
pod at `/connector-certs`. For the connector to find the certificates, the paths in the 
`config.json` have to be set to `/connector-certs/[certificate name]`. Alternatively, you can change the mount path 
of the secret at `volumeMounts`.

#### Starting the deployment

To start the deployment, execute the following command:

```
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

### Service

A service is an abstraction for a set of pods and defines how the set can be accessed. In a service, you can define e.g. 
what port your application should expose and under what name other services can reach it. The `service.yaml` gives 
an example on how to define a service for the Dataspace Connector. There are different types of services. The service 
type defaults to `ClusterIP` if not specified, as is the case here, meaning that it can be accessed by other services 
in the cluster using the service's `name` and `port`. To make the service accessible from outside the cluster, 
either choose a different [service type](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) or create an 
[Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/).

To start the service as type `LoadBalancer` (reachable from inside and outside the cluster), execute

```
kubectl expose -f service.yaml --type=LoadBalancer
```

Afterwards, you can find the IP of the Master node by executing

```
kubectl cluster-info
```

and the NodePort the service is running on by executing

```
kubectl describe service dataspace-connector
```

With this IP and port you can now reach the connector using e.g. cURL or an HTTP client.

Depending on the Kubernetes distribution you use, `kubectl` might have to be replaced with another command. 

* When using OpenShift, replace `kubectl` with `oc`. 
* When using MicroK8s, replace `kubectl` with `microk8s kubectl`
* When using Minikube, replace `kubectl` with `minikube kubectl --`
